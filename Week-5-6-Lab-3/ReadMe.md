-Description:
The objective of the lab is exploring K-means and K-Medoids  clustering algorithms. Both algorithms are applied on wine data obtained from SKlean library. Results are compared and final discussion is presented.
-Key Insights:
 On the provided dataset, better accuracy metrics results are obtained from K-mean than K-Medoids.
 K-mean results in more smooth and well grouped clusters compared\
 K-Mediods exhibits less uniform cluster formation.
-Challenge:
Creating the scatter plots of both clusters was a challenge until I read that we need to use PCA for that.
