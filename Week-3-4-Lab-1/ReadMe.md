This work is done as part of advanced big data and data mining UC course Lab-1. The work mainly focused on data preprocessing and cleaning for further analysis or model training. Daily weather data of different cities obtained from Kaggle is used to practice different data processing thecniques like data cleaning, sampling and reduction, statistical analysis, and data visualization. Data analysis is done on average temperature and percipitation data. Summer and Winter temprature data is analyzed. And some visualizations are done. Key challenges faced during the lab was data cleaning and vriablity over time.}
