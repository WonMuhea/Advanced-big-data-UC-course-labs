This lab focuses on classification of wine data obtained from Sklearn Library using KNN and RNN supervised learning algorithms.
We run KNN for K values of1, 5, 11, 15, and 21 and RNN for radius values of 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600.
Key Insights:
 KNN outperformed RNN
  KNN accuracy starts from 77% and grows as K value grows showing more accuracy
  RNN is found to be sensitive to radius values as increase in radius results in accuracy variability
Challenge:
   When calculating the metrics values, division by zero was causing issues and it was resolved by further reading.
